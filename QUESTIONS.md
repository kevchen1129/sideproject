## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example `QUESTIONS.md` file is in the `Examples` directory (QUESTIONS-example.md).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.
